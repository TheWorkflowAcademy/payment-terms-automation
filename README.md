## Core Idea
Some businesses have different payment terms for different customers. This means, when an invoice or bill is issued, the due date should differ based on these terms. Currently, there isn't a setting in **Zoho Books** that allows you to set unique date calculations for due date. This is where the custom function comes in. In this example, we will be using **Invoices** - When an invoice is created in **Zoho Books**, this script gets the invoice creation date, checks the payment term logic defined, calculates the due date from the invoice date and updates it in the invoice record.

## Configuration
A workflow rule that triggers upon invoice creation must be in place.

## Tutorial

### Get the Necessary IDs and Invoice Creation Date
```
invoiceID = invoice.get("invoice_id");
orgID = organization.get("organization_id");
invoicedate = invoice.get("date");
```

### Set Validation Criteria
Here is where you set the logic. In this example, if the payment term is "30", the script assign the **due date** to the 10th of the following month. Change this to suit any conditions and date calculations you may require.
```
if(invoice.get("payment_terms") = "30")
{
	duedate = invoicedate.addMonth(1).toStartofMonth().addDay(9);
}
```

### Update Due Date to the Invoice Record
Once the **due date** is set, convert it into the date format stored in the invoice record, and perform the **update**.
```
duedate = duedate.toString("YYYY-MM-dd");
update = zoho.books.updateRecord("Invoices",orgID,invoiceID,{"due_date":duedate});
```
